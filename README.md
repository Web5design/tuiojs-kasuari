Kasuari
=======

Kasuari is a web-based multi-scale image viewer. With Kasuari, you can view
a very large image on a web browser. You can zoom in and out to see more or
less detailed view of the image.

If you are familiar with Google Maps, then you should also familiar with
Kasuari. In fact, both are using the same technique to view a very large
image, such as a world map.
